    <h2 class="heading-one">The Pizza</h2>
        <p class="body-text-one">Neapolitan pizza originated in Naples, Italy, hundreds of years ago. 
            Why mess with a good thing? There is even an Italian non-profit organization—the True 
            Neapolitan Pizza Association (Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana), or AVPN—which is dedicated 
            entirely to protecting the integrity and tradition that go into an authentic Neapolitan pizza. </p>
    
        <p class="body-text-one">According to the AVPN, traditional Neapolitan pizza 
            has a few qualities that make it immediately recognizable:
        <ul class="list-one">
            <li>Round shape: Sorry, square pizza evangelists. Round is the way for this particular style.</li>
            <li>Sleek crust: This pizza has a raised edge of about two centimeters 
            and should never be burned. The crust is often soft with a pleasant elasticity.</li> 
            <li>Tomatoes: If canned, they should be crushed by hand. If fresh, they should be sliced.</li>
            <li>Cheese: Mozzarella slices should be spread evenly across the pizza.</li>
            <li>Garnishes: Fresh basil and extra virgin olive oil top the whole thing off.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>  
    <h5>The Dough</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup lukewarm water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon active-dry yeast</li>
        <li>10 ounces unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1.5 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>The Garnishes</h5>
    <ul>   
        <li>San Marzano Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Oregano</li>
        <li>Basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Assembly</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the dough: Mix flour, water, salt, 
            and yeast together until the desired consistency is achieved. Then roll out into a disk.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce: Crush or slice your tomatoes, simmer with olive oil, and season appropriately while 
            remembering that the beauty of this dish is simplicity.</li>
        <li>Assemble the pizza: Spread your sauce and space mozzarella slices evenly around the surface area.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza: Tradition dictates that the cooking should be done in a high-heat oven for a very short 
            period of time. It should also be cooked exclusively in a wood-fired oven, but I won’t tell if you won’t.</li>
        <li>Finish with garnishes: Add a drizzle of olive oil, a sprinkle of oregano, and a few fresh basil leaves. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
