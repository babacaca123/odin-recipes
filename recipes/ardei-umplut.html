    <h2>The Dish</h2>
        <p>Ardei Umpluți (stuffed peppers) is a classic Romanian dish that is a staple of any Romanian 
            grandma's kitchen.</p>
    
        <p>The basic outline of the dish is simple: 
              
             
        <ul>
            <li>Bell peppers are stuffed with a mixture of rice, minced meat, and spices</li>
            <li>Then baked until tender</li> 
            <li>The dish is often served with a side of sour cream or tomato sauce and crusty bread.</li>
             
        </ul>
        </p>    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>  
    
    
    <ul>
        <li>4 large bell peppers (any color)</li>
        <li>1 cup rice</li>
        <li>500g minced meat (beef, pork, or a mix)</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can diced tomatoes (400g)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
        <li>Olive oil (for drizzling)</li>
    </ul>

    
    <h2>Assembly</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).</li>
        <li>Cut the tops off the bell peppers and remove the seeds and membranes.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the rice, minced meat, chopped onion, minced garlic, diced tomatoes, paprika, salt, and pepper. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Stuff each bell pepper with the meat and rice mixture, pressing down gently to pack it in.</li>
        <li>Place the stuffed peppers upright in a baking dish. Drizzle with olive oil and add a splash of water to the bottom of the dish.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until the peppers are tender and the filling is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh parsley before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <h6>Optionally, you can cook the dish in boiling water over a stove until the rice is soft for a more juicy texture. 
        Just make sure to add some tomato sauce for extra flavor.</h6>
